        Information") we gather when you are using or accessing AppHunt. This Privacy Policy also
        covers
        our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that

        and
        applications ("Third Party Services") that you elect to access through AppHunt, or to
        individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to
        those
        Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility

        is
        necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.
    </p>

        uniform

        and

        Twitter,
        Facebook, and /or Google feeds and the original URL, and associate that information with
        your

        of
        users accessing AppHunt and its various streams of content. We may use this data in
        aggregate
        form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you
        personally.

        Some
        of this information is derived from Personal Information, such as your location (which, in
        turn,
        can be derived from your IP address or through location based services used by your device).
        This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you,
        your
        Account, your web browser or your AppHunt application.</p>

    <p><b>How and To Whom Is My Information Shared?</b>
    </p>

    <p>AppHunt is designed to help you share information that you or people you choose to follow
        locate
        on the web with others. As a result, much of the information generated through AppHunt is
        shared
        publicly or with third parties. All AppHunt content is public. Your activity on the AppHunt
        network is public and can be distributed to anyone that follows you. We may also distribute
        content and feeds through an email digest to users who have elected to receive such email
        digests.</p>

    <p><i>Public AppHunt Activity Information:</i></p>

    <p>Some of your activity on and through AppHunt is public by default. This includes, but is not
        limited to, apps or URLs that you have shared or submitted to AppHunt. Individuals reading
        this
        information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and
        without your knowledge. Therefore, we urge you to think carefully about these actions.
    </p>

    <p><i>User Profile Information:</i></p>

    <p>User profile information including your username, avatars or images you elect to upload and
        other
        information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate commentId interaction
        within
        AppHunt. We will not directly reveal users' email addresses to other users.
    </p>

    <p><i>Aggregate Information:</i></p>

    <p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with
        whom
        we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can
        understand
        how and how often people use AppHunt and their services or websites, which facilitates
        improving
        both their services and how we interface with them. In addition, these third parties may
        share
        with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they
        have
        independently developed or acquired.</p>

    <p><i>Information Shared with Our Agents:</i></p>

    <p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our
        behalf
        and who are under our control (our "Agents"). We may need to share Personal Information with
        our
        Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our
        Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with
        them
        beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal
        Information
        with our Agents.
    </p>

    <p><i>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</i></p>

    <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, commentId
        information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or
        substantially all of our assets associated with AppHunt, were acquired, or in the unlikely
        event
        that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, commentId information would be one of the
        assets that
        is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur,
        and
        that any acquirer of us may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this
        policy.</p>

    <p><i>Information Disclosed for the Protection of Us and Others:</i></p>

    <p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it
        reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
        process or
        governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of
        potential
        violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
        issues, (iv) respond to commentId support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or
        safety,
        our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
        organizations for fraud protection and spam prevention.

    </p>

    <p><i>Information We Share With Your Consent:</i></p>

    <p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared
        with
        third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>Your Account information (including your Twitter, Facebook, Google or other third-party
        logins)
        is protected for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your

        your account.
    </p>

    <p>We endeavor to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we
        cannot
        guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
        software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of commentId information at
        any
        time.
    </p>

    <p>We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using
        industry-standard security techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques
        will

    </p>

    <p>Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by visiting Accout Settings in
        the
        AppHunt mobile application. If you terminate and delete your Account, any association
        between

    </p>

    <p><b>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?</b>
    </p>

        may
        be needed to take advantage of some AppHunt features.
    </p>

    <p>You can delete your Account or adjust your Account's privacy settings. Please note that we
        will
        need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account, and activity generated
        prior
        to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.
    </p>

    <p><b>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</b>
    </p>

    <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is
        subject
        to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in
        the
        way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on or
        within
        AppHunt or sending you an email. A commentId is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy
        when he or
